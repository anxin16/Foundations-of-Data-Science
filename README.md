# Foundations of Data Science
A warm welcome to the Springboard Foundations of Data Science Workshop!

Our team of industry experts has picked the best learning resources on Data Science and structured them into a logical curriculum for you. We curate content from a wide range of sources, giving you breadth and depth from multiple perspectives rather than a single textbook or tool. This is our unique strength - we stand on the shoulders of giants, instead of being restricted to a single source. In addition to this wealth of resources, we provide the glue that stitches everything together and opportunities to practice and connect what you learn.

### What you will learn

'Data Scientist' has been called the 'sexiest job of the 21st century'. McKinsey, a top consulting firm, predicts a shortage of over 250,000 data science and analytics experts in the next 5 years. Whether you're looking to transition to a new career, or get new and relevant skills for your current job, learning more about data science can only help you take your skills to the next level.

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of data science, starting with the R programming language, one of the most popular tools used by data scientists in industry. After you have a solid foundation in R, you'll cover all of the steps in the data science process, including data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis and the basics of machine learning and predictive analysis. In addition to the techniques and programming skills, you'll learn how to present your work in the form of effective data stories.
